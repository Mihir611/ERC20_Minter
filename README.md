# ERC20_Minter
A Simple ERC20_Minter DApp 

This Dapp is responsible only for minting a custom ERC20 Token.

This Dapp is built using Openzeppelin, hardhat and svelte where hardhat is used to deploy the smartcontract in a node provider preferably Alchemy or infura and svelte is used for the UI using which the user can mint his own tokens.
